# Breast Cancer Detection using DDMS Dataset

This notebook (`ddms-breast-cancer-detection-dice-focal-loss-commented.ipynb`) demonstrates how to build a breast cancer detection model using custom loss functions (Dice Loss and Focal Loss) on the **DDSM (Digital Database for Screening Mammography)** dataset.

 
The DDSM dataset is available on **Kaggle**:
**Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sdalab1402/ddsm-mammography-data

Ensure the dataset is added to the notebook by:
1. Going to the **Kaggle notebook editor**.
2. Clicking on the **+ Add Data** button.
3. Searching for `"ddsm-breast-cancer-dataset"` and adding it to your notebook.

 

Make sure the following libraries are installed (usually preinstalled in Kaggle):
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

 

1. Upload this notebook to your **Kaggle account** or open in **Google Colab** (after downloading the dataset manually).
2. Add the DDSM dataset as described above.
3. Run the notebook cell by cell to:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Define custom loss functions (Dice Loss, Focal Loss)
   - Train a deep learning model
   - Evaluate and visualize results

 
 

- The code is commented with `# TODO:` markers to help you understand each part and customize as needed.
- You may adjust batch size, number of epochs, or model architecture based on your computational environment.
